1) In CITEST, add experiment and associated info  to CITEST_SetupStimParam
at the line with "switch expchoice"

2) CITest_Exp_Initialize
- returns information about the run-time mode and sub-experiment type
- within the internal call to 'runmode_popupmenu()', initialize and turn on/off
UI components within the experiment subGUI panel (the lower left panel in CITest)
as needed

3) CITest_Exp_GetPulseInfo
- associate subtype of experiment with the particular pulse parameters that the
BEDCS file requires; this can be customized, but it will be more work

4) CITest_Exp_GetParameters
- grab all the stimulus parameters that aren't from the main CITEST GUI
- this now includes all pulse parameters accessible from the Pulse Mod menu;
polarity and interphase gap should always be included for completeness, even
when their values are not changeable
- this function is also the time to determine if any of the main CITEST parameters
are invalid for the experiment/sub-experiment/run-time mode; if so, declare a
warning and make 'expParam' empty
- 'expHandles' contains the exp subGUI's UI handles; 'handles' is for the main GUI
- if a secondary channel is defined, such as for masking, this function must create
fields in 'expParam' called '.electrode2', '.level', 'configcode', etc (i.e. parallel
to the structure of 'mainParam' except the electrode string has a "2")
- also, must set 'expParam.phcharge' to a value that best reflects the phase duration for
purposes of charge-based current limits; usually the 'pulseSettings.phdur' value for primary channel is OK; but if a really long phase duration is defined and it's not attenuated proportionally, a higher value may be necessary

5) CITest_Exp_TransformParameters
